# Neural-Networks


## Iris
  - Multi-layer Perceptron classifier to classify Iris species. 

## Cluster 
  - Multi-layer Perceptron classifier to classify a random dataset. 
  
Part 1:
- Encode clusters A and C with the same label, then B and D with another label (2 clusters), create a NN classfier and train it and evaluate the performance of the proposed classifier
	
Part 2
 - Encode the prediction A, B, C, D as 4 clusters, create a NN classfier and train it and evaluate the performance of the proposed classifier
