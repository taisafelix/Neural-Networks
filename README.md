## Iris
  - Multi-layer Perceptron classifier to classify Iris species. 

## Cluster 

Be a random dataset generated log: 

K = 1000	q = 0.6 

A = [rand(1,k) – q; rand(1,k)+q]

B = [rand(1,k) + q; rand(1,k)+q]

C = [rand(1,k) + q; rand(1,k)-q]

D = [rand(1,k) – q; rand(1,k)-q]

Part 1:
- Encode clusters A and C with the same label, then B and D with another label (2 clusters), create a NN classfier and train it and evaluate the performance of the proposed classifier
	
Part 2
 - Encode the prediction A, B, C, D as 4 clusters, create a NN classfier and train it and evaluate the performance of the proposed classifier
